### Colored

`Teaching mode` can add an outline for each recommended action on your hot bar to teach you which action you should use next time. You can also change the color for it.

`Simulate the effect of pressing` can simulate the clicking effect on your hot bar for fun. You can make it more intense if you change the times and interval.
